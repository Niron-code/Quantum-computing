# Quantum Computing - WEEK2

This folder contains Python scripts for visualizing and converting complex numbers and vectors between polar and rectangular forms.

## Files

- **arith_calc.py**
  - Performs arithmetic operations on complex numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - Visualizes the results as vectors using matplotlib.
  - Prompts the user for input and displays results in both algebraic and graphical form.

- **polar_cartisian.py**
  - Converts between polar and rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates.
  - Visualizes vectors in both forms using matplotlib.
  - Interactive menu for conversion and visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```powershell
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

Run scripts from the terminal:
```powershell
python arith_calc.py
python polar_cartisian.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter complex numbers or coordinates and view the results and visualizations.
